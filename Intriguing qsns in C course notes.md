## 1. IBM Mainframe System/360  - 1964

The **IBM System/360** (**S/360**) is a family of [mainframe computer] systems announced by [IBM] on April 7, 1964 and delivered between 1965 and 1978
Operating system	-  BOS/360TOS/360DOS/360OS/360TSS/360
Memory	8 KB – 9 MB (core memory) (thin-film memory on the Model 95))

The slowest System/360 model announced in 1964, the Model 30, could perform up to 34,500 instructions per second, with memory from 8 to 64 KB.High-performance models came later. The 1967 IBM System/360 Model 91 could execute up to 16.6 million instructions per second. The larger 360 models could have up to 8 MB of main memory,though that much memory was unusual; a large installation might have as little as 256 KB of main storage, but 512 KB, 768 KB or 1024 KB was more common. Up to 8 megabytes of slower (8 microsecond) Large Capacity Storage (LCS) was also available for some models.

The weight of the IBM System/360 mainframe depends on the model and its memory and processor configuration: 
Model 65: Weighs 4,290–8,830 lbs (1,946–4,005 kg) 
Model 75: Weighs 5,125–5,325 lbs (2,325–2,415 kg) 
Model 67: Weighs 3,674 lbs (1,666 kg) 
Model 44: Weighs 2,900–4,200 lbs (1,315–1,905 kg) 
Model 30: Weighs 1,700 lbs 

In general, the original mainframes were room-sized and occupied 2,000–10,000 square feet. Today's mainframes are about the size of a large refrigerator.

## II. Which of the following is/are true for the C programming language?

It is an imperative programming language
It is a statically typed language
It is a strongly typed language
It is a structured programming language
It demands a high capacity hardware.

### Accepted Answers:

It is an imperative programming language
It is a statically typed language


## C is an imperative programming language 

Imperative programming is a paradigm where you explicitly state how the program should achieve the desired result. You write step-by-step instructions for the computer to follow. This paradigm is closer to the machine’s way of thinking and requires a clear understanding of the system’s internals.
Imperative programming is often compared to a cookbook recipe. It gives you a list of ingredients (data) and step-by-step instructions (code) on how to cook the dish (outcome). These instructions often include loops, conditionals, and variable assignments.
Popular examples of imperative programming languages include C, Java, and Python. These languages provide granular control over the system, making them suitable for tasks that require extensive system manipulation.

### Opposite to Imperative language is Declarative language 

Declarative programming is a paradigm that focuses on what the program should achieve, without explicitly stating how to achieve it. It is a high-level concept that abstracts the intricacies of the underlying system.

In declarative programming, you express the logic of a computation without revealing its control flow or state management. You define the desired result and let the system figure out the steps to achieve that result.

Declarative programming is widely used in areas such as database management (SQL), configuration management (Puppet, Chef), and front-end UI design (HTML, CSS). It offers several benefits, such as simplicity, readability, and predictability, which make it a popular choice among programmers.

## C is a statically typed language

**Statically typed languages:** Statically typed languages are the languages like **C, C++, Java**, etc, In this type of language the data type of a variable is known at the compile time which means the programmer has to specify the data type of a variable at the time of its declaration. We have to pre-define the return type of function as well as the type of variable it is taking or accepting for further evaluations.

**Dynamically typed language:** These are the languages that do not require any pre-defined data type for any variable as it is interpreted at runtime by the machine itself. In these languages, interpreters assign the data type to a variable at runtime depending on its value. We don’t even need to specify the type of variable that a function is returning or accepting in these languages. **JavaScript, Python, Ruby, Perl**, etc are examples of dynamically typed languages.

## C is a structured programming language

Structured programming and procedural programming are closely related but distinct programming paradigms. C is often considered a procedural programming language, but it also supports structured programming.

Procedural Programming:

Procedural programming is a paradigm that focuses on procedures or functions. In procedural languages, the program's functionality is organized into procedures or functions, which are called in a sequence to accomplish a task. These procedures typically manipulate data and follow a top-down approach. Key characteristics of procedural programming include:

1. Emphasis on Procedures: The main building blocks of a program are procedures or functions, which contain code to perform specific tasks.
2. Data and Functions: Data is separate from functions, and functions act on data using parameters and return values.
3. Sequential Execution: Procedural programs typically follow a linear or sequential flow of execution.
4. Limited Data Hiding: Procedural languages have limited support for data hiding and encapsulation.

Structured Programming:

Structured programming is a subset of procedural programming that enforces a more organized, systematic approach to coding. It emphasizes the use of structured control flow constructs like loops and conditionals to promote readability, maintainability, and error reduction. Key characteristics of structured programming include:

1. Structured Control Flow: The use of structured constructs like "if-else" statements and loops (e.g., "for" and "while") to control program flow.
2. Single Entry, Single Exit: Functions or procedures should have a single point of entry and exit to ensure clear control flow.
3. Modularization: Programs are divided into smaller, more manageable modules or functions to improve code reusability and maintenance.

C as a Procedural and Structured Language:

C is often referred to as a procedural programming language because it allows you to write programs in a procedural style, using functions to organize code and data. However, it also supports structured programming. In C, you can use structured constructs like "if-else" statements, loops, and functions, making it possible to write well-structured and organized code.

While C does not enforce the use of structured programming, it provides the flexibility for programmers to choose between procedural or structured styles. This flexibility allows C to be used for low-level systems programming, where a more procedural approach is often needed, as well as for high-level application development, where structured programming can enhance code readability and maintainability.

In summary, C is a programming language that can be used for both procedural and structured programming. Its flexibility and simplicity make it a versatile language for various applications and programming styles.


## C is not a strongly typed language

In computer programming, a programming language is strongly typed if it demands the specification of data types. A programming language is loosely typed, or weakly typed, when it does not require the explicit specification of different types of objects and variables. The "looser" typing rules in weakly typed programming languages can produce erroneous or unpredictable results. It can execute implicit type conversions at runtime.

In programming languages, the concepts of strong and weak, or loose, typing are related to but different from static and dynamic typing. A programming language that is strongly typed can be either statically or dynamically typed.
